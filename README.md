## Current state

Underverse is usable, but there is no stable binary release yet.  
*Use at your own risk!*

## Obtaining Underverse

Please use git to clone the most recent development version:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/marc-sturm/Underverse.git

Then, open the `src/Underverse.pro` file in QtCreator and build the application.  
After a successfull build, the binary can be found in the `bin` folder.
